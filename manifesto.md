## What is the show trying to express?
As a designer with multicultural backgrounds, Demna is much more sensitive to elements that are outside of design art. Lets first take a look at these two quotes from him:
 - `I like that people think my clothes are ugly. I think it is a compliment.`
 - `I think it’s also very interesting to find this line where ugly becomes beautiful and beautiful becomes ugly.`
 
Demna wants people to view ugliness before recognizing what is actually beauty by challenging the viewer with visually striking elements in his design. By having these abnormal and challenging elements, the designer does not only want to challenge modern aesthetics, but he also wants to people to reflect on the current society. The designer is trying to convey the necessity to pay attention to youth and also to reflect on technology.
